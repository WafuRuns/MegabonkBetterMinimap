# MegabonkBetterMinimap

A BepInEx 6 mod for Megabonk that allows you to resize and zoom out the minimap, open the full map, etc.

**Definitely need help with some features in TODO, mod works well, but a lot of improvements are planned and it would be a shame to not finish this because of my lack of experience with modding Unity games.**
